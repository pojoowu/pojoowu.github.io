Hi, I am Yu-Han. I have been a PhD student in [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/) at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/) since September 2024. I am supervised by [Gérard Biau](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~biau/), [Claire Boyer](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~claire.boyer/) and [Pierre Marion](https://pierremarion23.github.io/). I am also part of the co-advised PhD student program at Google DeepMind, co-advised by Quentin Berthet and Romu Ellie. My research interests include: diffusion models, regularizations, ratent representation learning.
