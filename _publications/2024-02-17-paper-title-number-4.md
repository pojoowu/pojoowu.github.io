excerpt: 'Let l_m be a sequence of m points on a line with consecutive points at distance one. Answering a question raised by Fox and the first author and independently by Arman and Tsaturian, we show that there is a natural number m and a red/blue-colouring of ùîºn for every n that contains no red copy of l_3 and no blue copy of l_m.'
